title: Breaking Games for Balance 2
---

Welcome back to this multi-part series on breaking games to balance them! In our last post, we discussed some of the symptoms of a broken game, and now we're going to begin trying to discover those problems in the free print-and-play game [Forsaken Gods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--_soZprsUVg0Ruc9d_Q3tjEz4k5XSdHwVawHCcgVAY/edit). I will take you through my process for finding broken games, one that is by no assurances the best one, but the one that makes the most sense to me.

## Mechanics
The first thing to look for is any mechanics that *feel* broken to me. This isn't to say that they are broken, but these are the first things I want to test out to find out if they *are* broken. I'll go through the evergreen mechanics listed in the rules book below and give my thoughts on each of them.

|Mechanic|Thoughts|
|---|---|
|Bow|Effectively just tapping. This seems so basic that it would be impossible to break. If something allows you to un-bow followers, then this might be worth looking into, but for now it seems to be just a part of the game functioning.|
|Arrival|An enter the battlefield trigger. These can be useful, but don't jump out as broken. They happen once and would require synergy to break.|
|Devotion|An interesting mechanic that would make some cards become more useful in a long game. This one has some promise to be broken.|
|Onslaught|This one is more difficult to evaluate. At a cursory glance, it seems like the best strategy would be to focus all of your efforts on two lanes and abandon the third, but we will see if this is the case. If it isn't, then onslaught could be very powerful.|
|Solitary|Probably bad. This effect would need to be quite powerful, or be in a spells matter deck for me to actually place any real value in this.|
|Masochist|Now this one is intriguing. With the power to heal a follower every turn, this one might be able to be relatively easily abused with a small setup. This is definitely something to look at carefully.|
|Urgency|Haste. Could be broken, probably not though. Also not exciting.|
|Breach|This is by far the mechanic I like the most so far. It rewards you for doing what you want to do anyways. This seems like an easily abusable mechanic.|
|Opposing Lane|A definition. Nothing to see here.|
|Vengeance|An interesting catch up mechanic. It might enable some all in strategies where you focus on two lanes and hope to lose the third. Definitely worth messing around with.|
|God Costs|Being able to summon these gods seems to be very costly. If they have powerful effects it might be worth it, but we'll see.|
|Swarm|I have no idea how to value this. It is costly to set up, but has the power to help you get further ahead in that lane. Again, a mechanic we need to see specific cards to evaluate.|
|Dreamcatcher|A defensive ability. May or may not be necessary depending on how good Ethereal is.|
|Gatecrash|Here it is! Another mechanic that feels like it could be absolutely busted!|
|Ethereal|Evasion, always a solid mechanic.|
|Teleport|This is an interesting mechanic, but I don't forsee it being super powerful.|
|Switch|Better teleport?|
|Abandon|This one has promise. With such a downside, they would need to be somewhat powerful to compensate, so they could be useful, especially paired with Onslaught.|
|Bounce|Good with Arrival and Urgency.|
|Drain|Good, solid value. If drain is too powerful it will run away with the meta.|
|Toxic|Deathtouch, Poison, etc. If this has strong toughness, this will be powerful, but otherwise it seems meh|
|Dying Breath|Similar to Arrival, just happens when things change zones, not super broken on the surface.|
|The Void|As we discussed previoulsy, if there are ways to interact with this discard zone, it will be very powerful.|
|Provoke|I like this as a defensive ability that still allows for aggressive play. It could be broken.|
|Shield|Ehh? Like okay? It enables two-for-ones, which are value. I'll be interested if there are other things that interact with it outside of it being simply a combat ability.|
|Sacrifice|A definition|
|Damage|A definition|
|Destroy|A definition|
|+1/+1 Counter|A definition|
|Leader|Here's another good mechanic! This one seems like it could easily slot in with some of the other mechanics we've been excited about. It seems to reward you for doing what you want to do anyways.|
|Honorbound|A defensive ability that seems to be limited. It might disrupt your opponents plans, but I don't hold my breath with this one.|
|Heal|A definition|
|Defend|Now here's another exciting one. This allows you to ignore the lanes within the game. Another mechanic that might be able to be easily exploited. We shall see.|
|Collective|STORM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|
|Gain Control|A definition, but it makes an interesting not. If you would gain control of a creature, but don't have space, it simply dies. This might mean that instead of removal you only need to try to gain control of followers. This might be genuinely broken.|
|Possession Card|Static effects can always be interesting to look at, so this could run away quickly if there is no way to interact with them.|
|Follower|A definition|
|Forbid|I think this is a counter spell, but the game says nothing about playing cards on your opponents turn. This might be confusing.|
|God|Having to pay this cost three times if you have all your lines but only once if you only have one lane makes this feel like an interesting catch up mechanic.|
|God Power|These are cool! Basically hearthstone's hero powers, and we're gonna review these next.|
|Shrine|The basic resource of the game. I really like the way they're set up, and I don't immediately see a way to break them.|
|Temple|Transform shrines into wild cards, now these feel like they allow you to run a couple out of color cards that could be broken. I'm more apprehensive about temples.|

Phew, that was a whole lot of mechanics! But at the end of it, we have nine mechanics that I think have the ability to be easily broken, so we'll focus our early testing on them! They are:
* Gatecrash
* Breach
* Abandon
* Vengeance
* Onslaught
* Provoke
* Leader
* Defend
* Collective

## God Powers
These god powers, in addition to the shrine system, are my two favorite parts of this game, so let's look at them next. These god powers allow you to take repeated actions every turn with only a two shrine commitment.

Strife: Deal 1 damage to any target in this lane - *Unlike the drain ability of Contagion, this allows you to burn down lanes. It can give you some inevitability in the late game, but seems like it may be too little to affect the game state in that way. In regards to removing followers, Contagion's ability is simply better at that.*

Infestation: Create a 1/1 Insect in this lane - *The value of tokens in this game will depend largely on how easy it is to get followers into lanes, if there are useful anthem effects, or if there are benefits to having large numbers of tokens/followers.*

Grandeur: Heal any target in this lane for 2 - *This seems quite good, and I really like it thematically. However, life gain strategies are often unviable in card games. If it is too easy to gain life, then everyone does it and you get into a virtual arms race of life points. If it is too difficult, those resources would be better spent in simply removing the other play/the sources of damage. The power of this ability will depend on the synergies available with life gain.*

Contagion: Drain any follower in this lane for 1 - *This is my second favorite god power of all. It combines affecting the board state with gaining life, and doing damage. All of this combines to make it my favorite ability for use in lane.*

Occult: Draw a card and then discard a card - *Yeah this is busted. Looting effects are so good, and I anticipate this being the best by far. In addition, since you have only one hand, this mechanically affects the entire game instead of just a single lane, making it even better on face examination. I anticipate that one of the first things you will do in any game  is build a lane where you have two blue shrines on turn two.*

So if you can't tell, I think one of these abilities is far and above better than the others. Card advantage is everything in card games, and a looting effect is one of the strongest things that you can do.

**Footnote: This is called a looting effect because it comes from the MtG card, Faithless Looting. It lets you draw two cards and then discard two, and it is very powerful. Since Magic is such a dominant game in the trading card game market, I use the term since many players will already have this as a base framework for their evaluation of cards.**

## Cards
Now, time for the bread and butter of any card game! The cards themselves. Now, there's 40 pages of creatures, each page with like 8 creatures spoiled, so I'll link to the full spoiler [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--_soZprsUVg0Ruc9d_Q3tjEz4k5XSdHwVawHCcgVAY/edit) and just talk about the highlights in this part of the article. Additionally, unless there is something truly unique about the card, I'll only name them in the buckets where they are most valuable. So here goes, organized by God (color):

### Strife

Thoughts: Strife seems to be decent in its ability to deal damage to opposing followers, and it could be a very good splash color or closing color in order to keep your opponent at bay. It doesn't feel too fast despite the multiple urgency cards.

|Bucket|Cards|
|---|---|
|Value|Temple Runner; Vengeful Barbarian; Combat Reveler; War Celebrant|
|Closers|Disciple of Strife; Flame Rider; Strife, Lord of War; War Incarnate|
|Removal|Incinerate; Ignite; Scald|
|Card Advantage|Flaming Arrows; Blinding Blaze|

### Infestation

Thoughts: Infestation seems to go ultra hard on the ramp, and so unless there is some aggressive deck in the format, I don't see why every deck wouldn't run an Infestation Ramp package. Especially with cards like Acolyte of Faith just giving you shrines in the early game.

|Bucket|Cards|
|---|---|
|Value|Acolyte of Faith; Shrine Architect; Druid of Devotion; Call to Arms|
|Closers|Astral Crusher; Growth Incarnate; Infestation, God of Growth; Forest of Infestation; Insectile Invasion|
|Removal|Showdown|
|Card Advantage|Prayer for Intervention; Bolster Devotion|

### Occult

Thoughts: Occult doesn't have much in terms of removal other than bounce spells. With that being said, it has some damn good closers in Occult's Reckoning, Occult's Tome, and Occult, God of Mysticism. This seems to be an OP color, and it seems likely with all the card draw you could grind through most of your deck to set up a consistent win in just this color.

|Bucket|Cards|
|---|---|
|Value|Admirer of Revelation; Harbinger of Epiphany; Shaman of Marvel; Spiritual Enforcer; Mysticism Incarnate|
|Closers|Insight Seeker; Occult, God of Mysticism; Occult's Tome; Occult's Reckoning|
|Removal|Soul Cage?; Avenging Conscription?|
|Card Advantage|Acolyte of Inquiry; Professor of Truths; Shrine Investigator; Disciple of Occult; Divine Omen|

### Contagion

Thoughts: Contagion seems to have a ton of ways for you to put things into the Void, Sacrifice followers, and similar effects; however, the payoffs for those seem to be much weaker. I would want to see a card or two that has payoffs for filling the void before I really thought about a master contagion decklist.

|Bucket|Cards|
|---|---|
|Value|Acolyte of Consumption; Unstable Horror; Reckless Abomination; Disciple of Contagion; The Void's Embrace|
|Closers|Void Warrior; Thrashing Horror; Monk of Unknown Horrors; Contagion, God of Decay|
|Removal|Toxic Abomination; Putrefy|
|Card Advantage|Return from the Void; Drain Intellect; Rip from the Void|

### Grandeur

Thoughts: I love how Grandeur feels like there are two distinct decks that come out of it. There's the defensive deck with defender, shield, and healing effects that relies on a big finisher to close out the game, and there's a tempo deck that cares about counters and the leader effect. This god feels like it might have the best identity of all of them. That being said, it seems like Grandeur is lacking big closers and would look to win through more tempo gameplay and war of attrition style games.

|Bucket|Cards|
|---|---|
|Value|Acolyte of Honor; Kingdom Enforcer; Grizzled Veteran; Restore Faith|
|Closers|Grandeur, God of Glory; Armor Upgrade?; Grandeur's Reckoning?|
|Removal|Dematerialize; Place in the Pillory; Vanquish|
|Card Advantage|Prepare for Battle?|

## Final Thoughts
So at this point, I've examined every part of this game and it's time to start building decks and throwing them at each other to try to crack the meta-game wide open on day 0. Unfortunately, this blog post is already the longest one I've ever written, so we're going to go ahead and split the deck building into the next post! After that, I'll play a bunch of games and report back with my findings and tuned lists in a further post, and finally give a final verdict on my views of the meta-game of this unreleased, in design game, as well a discuss how I would go about changing the design to account for those systems.

Until next time.
