title: The Problem with Clash of Clans
---

## Clash of Clans
For the uninitiated, Clash of Clans was the granddaddy of all mobile RTS games. Released in 2012, it effectively set the tempo for what mobile RTS would be. The ever increasing wait times to do things, the power creep with later and later game resource, and the micro-transactions. The micro-transactions were something that I couldn't have imagined would become so integral to the world of gaming, but here we are. Dozens of spin off games have also tried to capture this same user fascination and desire to spend money in progression. But this isn't a critique of the entire mobile gaming genre, though that certainly could be a piece in the future, this is more tailored to the thing I love the most about Clash of Clans. The same thing that has me currently hooked on Egg Inc. Leveling and Progression Systems.

See, within Clash of Clans, you build a base. And every action takes a certain amount of time. So therefore, if you want to progress quickly without spending money, something I always want to do, you've got to Min-Max the crap out of your actions. As soon as you get the notification that a long build is finished, you're in the game. You make sure that you complete all of the short, quick actions immediately and then set out to finish another long one. When I was playing Clash, I would repeat this task constantly. I was always checking the game. Some would say my play style bordered on obsession, but I loved it. I could only keep that pace up for so long though. During the summer months, I would spike hard, but when school started again, I couldn't possibly keep up.

So what's the problem with Clash of Clans? It incentivizes constant attention in order to maintain the progression and growth that I play the game for.

## Civilization
"But Andey," I hear you say, "there's other games that give you the ability to work through tech trees and progression systems on your own time scale. Why not just play those?" Well, let's talk about Civilization then. Civilization would be one of those games. It gives you, the player, plenty of time to consider your actions, pick the right ones, and slowly dominate the entire game space. And you're right! It totally does let you do that. But does it have the combat system Clash does? The second half of the gameplay formula of Clash of Clans is the direct, head-to-head conflict with other human players.

You climb the ladder in a series of subsequent battles that put your short term tactics, or micro, against an opponents long term defensive strategy, or macro. This conflict of micro and macro is part of what I love about Clash of Clans. Both aspects are relatively easy to understand, but very difficult to feel as if you have mastered. Civilization doesn't do this for me. It very much feels like a game where you can ignore most of the micro and focus instead on the macro aspects such as foreign relations, military maneuverings, and spreading out forces. Both games scratch very different itches.

## Starcraft
"Okay Andey, ya weirdo," I'm sure you're continuing, "why don't you just play a regular old RTS then? Starcraft is a great example of what you want-."

No. Starcraft is a wonderful game, yes, but my issue with Starcraft is that it's nearly impossible to know what to do when you hop on the ladder. Civilization does a strong job of giving you ever increasing options and so does Clash of Clans. Starcraft says, here's everything you can do, pick something. Again, Starcraft is a phenomenal game. I absolutely love it, but it doesn't feel at all to me like Clash of Clans does.

## So what game do you want?
I'm imagining a game where you're able to get the same real time progression feelings that you can get from Clash of Clans and Starcraft, but you only have to invest a short amount of time into a game like you do in Starcraft and Civ. A game where you can spend all day talking about the strategy, but when you sit down to play, you have a period of time where you know you have to try-hard and that's it. A game where people who can simply devote more time to a game like Clash of Clans, wont be able to outpace you simply because they have more time. A game that builds the same community of friends as all these other games, but gives us a reason to get together all the time. And I have an idea for this game, but before I share it with you, I'm going to talk about one more game.

## Minecraft: Race for the Wool
If you have no idea what this is from reading the title, I would suggest you Google some playthrough of it. I certainly could talk about it in length, but now isn't the time. What I love most about Race for the Wool is that it takes the feeling of other game modes and creates a long game to play. Unlike lots of long co-op games that take tens of hours or more to complete, this is a relatively short experience. But it's still long enough that you truthfully have to make a day of it since it could last four or five hours. It's a game that fits perfectly into the digital age of Twitch and YouTube since one game makes the perfect length for a series or stream.

So can we take the ideas of Clash of Clans' asynchronous fighting, combine it with Civilization's tech trees and Starcraft's strong competitive environment in order to create a game that feels like Race for the Wool? I have no idea, but we're going to try.

## Level Up
This game, one that I'm nicknaming Level Up until I have a stronger theme and name, seeks to do just that. It will be a game about quickly building up resources and systems that help you protect yourself from the people around you in the early game. As you move into the middle game, you have the chance to select a tech tree to fully explore or multiple to diversify yourself, but you certainly won't have time for both. As the game begins to wrap up in the end game, players will quickly drop out as one player finally hits some critical mass of progression that allows them to sweep other players, gaining things from them to help stomp the rest of the competition.

You may notice that I haven't painted very specific details about this game, but that is because I don't have them. This is another one of my lovely half baked ideas, but one that I've wanted to bring to life for years. So, for my first full game that I commit to seeing through to some form of a release, I'm proud to say that this is the game I want to make.

Until next time.

P.S. - The Breaking Games for Fun and Balance series is still in the works! Unfortunately a University schedule makes it hard for me to sit down and playtest a game for hours on end. Part 3 will be coming out (hopefully) during Thanksgiving break and Parts 4 and 5 during winter break! Sorry for the delay, because I really loved that series so far, but school is just kicking my butt this year.
