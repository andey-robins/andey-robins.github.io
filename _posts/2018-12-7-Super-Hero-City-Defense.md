title: Super Hero City Defense
---

Some of the most interesting games in my opinion make use of asynchronous design principles. They embrace the idea that a game can't be completely equal on all counts, and lean into that curve. This is the principle I'm going to use as the core gameplay experience for my newest project.

##The Game
Players divide into two groups. One plays as a super villain trying to destroy the city, and the rest of the players are superheroes who have been tasked with foiling the villians plans. The heroes collectively control 9 heroes, each with their own unique play styles. The villain must rampage through the town destorying each of five historic landmarks. After each is destroyed, his powers grow. Special events occur, drawing both the heroes and the villain to battles over special places.

This system uses an inherently asynchronous system. Due to his questionable ethical code, when the villain is matched up against a single hero, he has a considerable advantage. Having two heroes against a single villain gives the even gameplay experience that most other games try to religiously follow. Once three heroes are present, their numbers will almost certainly be enough to take down the supervillain.

##Magic
As a piece of design work, Magic: the Gathering is most certainly my favorite example. The format Archenemy takes this asynchronous play experience and executes it wondefully. All four players all have a regular 60 card deck, but instead of the game being a simple 3v1, a twist is added. The Archenemy, the supervillain in my game, has an additional deck full of powerful cards known as schemes. These cards shift the balance of the game back towards center. Without the schemes, the game is easily won by the three, but with this one little twist, a wonderfuly dynamic and fair gameplay experience is formed.

The spirit of Archenemy is what my game is trying to capture. Asynchronous games are all about throwing the power dynamic out of balance and then piling on benefits and features until a fun, fair experience can be had for all.

##Deck and Archetype Design
Mark Rosewater wrote a beautiful [article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2002-03-08) about designing for three different types of players. He names them Timmy, Jenny, and Spike, three names that I see no reason to change as I continue my writings on game design. (In fact, the article I linked to above is one of my favorite game design articles, so I would reccomend reading that before anything else I write). The biggest problem I see with my game is going to be having a play style in each interaction that the players will be interested in playing. As a result, I've divided my proposed deck archetypes into three categories, one for each player.

|Timmy|Jenny|Spike|
|---|---|---|
|Ramp|Storm|Burn|
|Tokens|Tribal|Control|
|Stompy|Triggers|Graveyard|

As development progresses, I'll delve into each of these archetypes in more detail, but overall, they represent a variety of different gamestyles and playtypes so that hopefully everyone will have two or three decks that they are truly excited to play.

As for the villain, he definitely fits into a more Spike-y playstyle. His deck will feature discard, sacrifice, mill, and prison elements. Another major design problem will be making it so that players who aren't very "take-that" style gamers will have somethings that they can enjoy doing as the supervillain.

##Conclusion
Overall, as I kick off the development process on this game, something I'm tentatively calling Heroes, I'm excited and optimistic. I believe there's going to be enough variety so that most types of card-game players will have something to do. Hopefully the storyline will be compelling enough to keep players entertained and engaged throughout the process. Unil next time.
