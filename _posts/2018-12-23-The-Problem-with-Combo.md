title: The Problem with Combo
---

## Combo Decks
When I played the modern format for Magic, my favorite decks were the engine/combo style decks (i.e. Hollow One and Storm). In Magic, since resources are woven into the deck, there's always the change to "whiff" your draws and not find the pieces of the combo that you're looking for. Despite this inherent randomness, a good storm player is still able to win on turn three or four, and I can usually win by turn five.

In a format like Modern, where most games last less than six or seven turns, a combo deck that has a clock firmly at the average number of turns makes sense. It keeps slower decks in check, since they will lose to the inevitability of Storm's engine. However, taking four or five turns to win is never going to be fast enough against Burn, a deck that can consistently win on the end of their third or fourth turn.

## Designing Combos that Aren't Oppressive
The problem with Heroes, and by a larger extent the problem with my design skills, is that there will definitely be a combo deck present in the game. By trying to cater to a variety of players by including this playstyle, it must work and be viable within the game world. A game that features a successful combo deck places a timer on the game. With the current design for my combo deck, it averages a six turn goldfish win. So, by extending the ideas of Magic, the villain deck needs to goldfish for a five turn win.

### One Hero
In a One Hero vs Villain situation, the combo deck should nearly always lose. To do that, the villain has to be able to goldfish one turn faster than the combo player. So the five/six turn time segment. However, the villain will be playing many different "taxing" style effects, such as hand attack and discard spells. So, the chances of them being able to disrupt the combo are pretty high. I think it's reasonable for the deck to take the same number of turns as the combo deck in this situation since the villain player is trying to grind out incremental advantage over an extended game.

### Two Heroes
In a Two Hero vs Villain situation, the result should be as close to 50/50 as possible. It should come down to playing well and just a little bit of luck. In this scenario, the keys that keep storm in check will be spread out between two of the players instead of just the one, so the combo deck will be able to win faster/with less redundancy. This pushes the game time closer to the six turn goldfish clock that the combo deck has, and so the combo deck warps the design of the game even more.

### Three Heroes
In a Three Hero vs Villain situation, the game should be more in the heroes favor. In this instance, the game will already be shifted into the Heroes favor, and a deck that closes the games out faster is less of a problem. (Or at least I believe that to be the situation right now. Perhaps when I start playing the game, the reality will be different). The six turn clock of the combo deck will result in, hopefully, a fun, timed experience.

## In Closing
Overall, I think that the presence of a combo deck is important for a certain type of player's enjoyment of the game. It helps hold the time of the game in check. The sheer existence of a combo deck warps the format around that deck, and as long as it fits comfortably in the center of the time in the format, it provides a healthy experience. If it doesn't though, it either forces players to learn a style of play that they don't enjoy just to win, or punishes players for playing the archetype that they enjoy the most.

I'll be watching the combo deck in this game diligently, because I believe the standing of combo decks is a good indicator of the health of a metagame. Until next time.
