title: Breaking Games for Balance

## Balance
One of the most difficult parts of designing a game, after making it fun of course, is making it balanced. Balance is the hidden engine that runs the game. Without a balanced environment, players will be forced into one playstyle or another if they want to win, regardless of if they want to play in that way. On the other side of the balance coin, if everything is perfectly symmetrical, there is no reason to ever change what you play. These are the two major systems that need to be balanced in game design: the mechanics/gameplay systems and the meta-game system. As is common on this blog, we're going to look at Magic the Gathering to discuss how these two can be balanced. We're also going to look at the game [Forsaken Gods](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletopgamedesign/comments/cqid8g/im_looking_for_keen_deck_builders_to_try_to_break/), a print-and-play expandable card game that was posted to the [tabletop game design subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletopgamedesign/).

## Mechanics and Gameplay
This is arguably the most important component of balance within a game. If one mechanic is far better than any of the other mechanics, players that want to win will invariably use that mechanic. For instance, let's look at the most recent Magic the Gathering Grand Prix where Modern was the format. Modern is the format that blends accessibility with a large card pool, so the most powerful cards from the last fifteen years naturally float to the top. Some cards are banned because they impact the metagame too much, a topic we'll elaborate on below, but some systems within the game are simply too powerful.

Grand Prix Minneapolis had 952 players register decklists. In a format as open as modern, it's strange to see so many of those decks using the graveyard as a key component in their strategy. Five out of the top 8 decks were graveyard decks (specifically they were Dredge, one of the two graveyard decks most likely to be voted degenerate by your graduating class). Two of them were aggro decks (Burn and Prowess) specifically built to beat those graveyard decks, and the other was humans. A quick perusal of other recent magic tournaments reveals that this breakdown, 60-80% of top 8 competitors use a graveyard deck (almost always Dredge or Hogaak). So why do we care about this?

The graveyard, or the discard pile in most games, is a key part of magic. It's meant to be the area where cards go when they can't be played with anymore. After you cast a spell or a creature dies, it makes sense not to be able to use it again. If you could, then resources wouldn't really be a concern in playing the game. And so decks that are able to use these cards multiple times can gain an advantage that other decks are unable to gain. By using a card three, four, or five times, it gets much more value than a card used once.

Because of the ability of these decks to recur their threats from a zone other decks can't easily interact with, they restrict the design space of the graveyard. If a card can too easily be brought back from the 'yard' (as the cool kids call it), it's going to be the best card to play (read: Hogaak).

Since this one part of the game, the graveyard, is so easy to abuse, the best players abuse it as much as possible, which leads us into meta-game concerns.

## Metagame
The meta-game is effectively, a game about the game. What deck you bring to a tournament, what deck you might assume your opponent is playing before seeing it, or even what types of cards are the best to counter your opponent are all part of the meta-game. In fact, anything about the game that takes place outside of playing an actual match can be considered to be a part of the meta-game. And broken mechanics go hand in hand with the meta-game. As we examined above, the graveyard, a somewhat broken part of the game of Magic, has shifted the metagame to be dominated by graveyard style decks and decks meant to punish graveyard decks.

In and of itself, having a strategy considered to be the best isn't a bad thing. Having a diverse meta-game, one where multiple strategies are viable in different situations and with different players, is indicative of a healthy design. The problems arise when one single path to victory is so good that, in order to win, someone has to play that strategy, our specifically counter it.

## Forsaken Gods
So what does Forsaken Gods have to do with this? Well, the designer has issued a call to action. They want players and fellow designers to try to break their game. And we're going to try to help them out. Allow me to quickly run through the rules of the game, but for a full set of the rules, click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EAmayyovMX_xccq5H6uf5fYSUfd5K1EdoZDOeePBR9I/edit).

In Forsaken Gods, players fight for the control of their realm in a godless world. They use the favor they garner with different pantheons to summon devotees and perform actions meant to decimate two of their opponents three kingdoms, crushing their dreams of dominion of all in the process. On a players turn, they gain a shrine in each of their three lanes. These shrines are dedicated to specific gods and are used to earn their favor within that lane.

Some of the other key components to this game:
* Each lane has 10 health
* Each lane can have up to 5 shrines
* Shrines can turn into temples later in the game (basically a wild card shrine)
* Each player brings a 40 card deck
* If you lost two lanes, you lose the game

There are, of course, other rules and parts of the game, but for a basic understanding this is a quick summary of the game. I would love to dive right into trying to break the game wide open and expose the meta-game warping strategies currently in the game, but this post has rambled on long enough talking about some of the problems we will be trying to search for in the balance of this game. Stay tuned as we dive into actually playing the game as well as discussing what the best strategies are and my suggestions on how the balance of the game could be changed to build a diverse, healthy meta.

Until next time.
